# Luhn-Checksum
Another Luhn-Checksum program written in Java. It's a bit messy but it works. 
This was a comprehensive lab project from my Introduction to Computer Science 1 course at the University of Texas at El Paso.
It was composed of 3 challenges, the 1st being to create a program that runs the Luhn Method. 
The second challenge was to read from a file containing 10 credit card numbers and print to the screen whether they are valid or not. 
The program then writes to a new file the names and credit card numbers of the individuals with invalid cards. 
The last challenge was a bonus to be able to produce a new valid credit card number that passes the Luhn Method every time the program is run.
